# QuarterMoon

Whith QuarterMoon I wanted to try out some code for 2D strategy games I had in mind for years.

## Requirements

### Hardware

I tested this on a machine like this:
* 1.66 Core2 Duo
* 2 GB RAM
* MESA graphics driver (practically none)

### Software
Since QuarterMoon is coded in Python, you'll need several installations first:
* Python (2.5 or above)		http://python.org/
* PyGame (1.91. or above)	http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml


## Run it on..

### ..Linux
Make sure, quartermoon.sh is executable:
		chmod +x ./quartermoon.sh

Run QuarterMoon:
		./quartermoon.sh

### ..Windows
There would be *several* ways:
* double click the .bat, if any
* double click the src\Controller.py
* type into the command line:
		python src\Controller.py
